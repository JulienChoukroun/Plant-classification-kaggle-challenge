# Kaggle Challenge: Plant classification

## Presentation
This project was carried out with the Python language.

### Purpose:
* Work with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques using Pl@ntNet Dataset https://plantnet.org/en/
* The public part of this dataset contains 306,293 images of 1081 different species. However, in the scope of this competition, I worked on a subset of that public set: 140,256 images from 153 species.
* Comparison of several deep learning models (efficient_net_b0, inception_resnet_v2)
* Use of data augmentation and confusion matrix.
